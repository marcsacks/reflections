How did viewing a diff between two versions 
of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff displays the difference between two files
so the it was easy to spot the bug as being a
difference introduced between versions.

How could having easy access to the entire 
history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?

It could provide an easy way to compare 
differences between versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you have greater control
Cons: you could wait too long to commit or commit too soon

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is designed with programming in mind

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

By typing them

How might using version control make you more 
confident to make changes that could break something?

Because it would be easy to fix

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
